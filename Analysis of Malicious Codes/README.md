### This is the tool I used when I studied Practical Malware Analysis book. I also got information from books or Googling. If there are any inaccuracies or errors or problems, please let me know. <br><br>


## TOOLS

- bintext
- upx
- peid

#### While studying, I felt that there were many old programs that did not work well, so I thought I wanted to make an analysis program.
#### Please take note of the advantages. And if there is a better program or something that is being developed in Python, I would appreciate it if you let me know.<br><br>
