#### I plan to organize what I studied and learn at school and share what I have studied.


### Learning English

 - Read documents in English where possible
 - Engine official manual, API documentation

    - Memorize a lot of English words
     - Read a lot of English books
     - Read a lot of papers and compare translations while reading English originals where possible
     - Write in English as much as possible
       - Listen to my favorite movies and pop songs (when coding)
       - Listen to English radio or news
       - Study for growth, study and communication, not for English test
       - Write as much English as possible
###### (And try to read in English what interests you. I read computer related articles in English and try to read information or books in English. Also, if you like games, watching overseas streaming seems to be the answer.)
