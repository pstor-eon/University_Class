#### I plan to organize what I studied and learn at school and share what I have studied.


### Learning English

 - Read documents in English where possible
 - Engine official manual, API documentation
 - stack overflow
    - Memorize a lot of English words
     - Read a lot of English books
     - Read a lot of papers and compare translations while reading English originals where possible
     - Write in English as much as possible
       - Listen to my favorite movies and pop songs (when coding)
       - Listen to English radio or news
       - Study for growth, study and communication, not for English test
       - Write as much English as possible
